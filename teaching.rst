I was a teaching assistant for Physics for Engineers I and II at `Carnegie Mellon University <http://www.cmu.edu>`_, 
several years ago.
Here are `some problem sets and figures <http://web.phys.cmu.edu/~yfeng1/home/Recitations/>`_ 
I reproduced from the textbooks for the students. I drew the figures with [Inkscape]_
