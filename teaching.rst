Over these summers at Berkeley I mentored several visiting students:

- Jaime Sahagun (Undergrad, UCB)

- Melissa Joseph (Undergrad, UCB)

- Lukas Heizmann (post-grad, MPA)

- Man-yat Chu (undergrad, Chinese University of Hong Kong)

- Biwei Dai (undergrad, PKU)

I was a teaching assistant for Physics for Engineers I and II at
`Carnegie Mellon University <http://www.cmu.edu>`_, 
several years ago.
Here are `some problem sets and figures <http://web.phys.cmu.edu/~yfeng1/home/Recitations/>`_ 
I reproduced from the textbooks for the students.
I drew the figures with [Inkscape]_
