        Probably need to put a `suited-up` picture here.


I am a Cosmology Data Science Fellow at `Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics <http://bccp.berkeley.edu>`_. 
I am also affliated with `Berkeley Institute for Data Science <http://bids.berkeley.edu>`_.

I write a lot of programs that produce and sweep through a lot of data; I mainly use `ViM <http://www.vim.org>`_ to
do the programming. Those are worthwhile and allowed to be hosted on the internet, and can be found at
`my github page <http://www.github.com/rainwoodman>`_. In earlier days I was involved with GNOME2 with a side-line project `gnome-globalmenu <https://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu>`_. 

I play guitars and do guitar set-ups for friends; for this purpose I mainly use allen wrenches
and philips screwdrivers: ViM doesn't help much on this issue. 

My professional work spans three fields: 

- Cosmology, 

- extreme-scale super-computing applications, and

- tools for scientific data science. 

Please refer to my `CV <https://www.overleaf.com/read/vwdhfqsbqtbq>`_; or 
`the list of publications <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?library&libname=Papers&libid=5516e5bffc>`_.

I was part of several largest cosmological simulations. 
These simulations required some of the largest super-computers today(or then), running at their full capability 
for days; that's hundreds of millions of CPU-hours.  
We do make important predictions about blackholes and galaxies with these simulations!

- `The MassiveBlack Simulation <http://gigapan.com/gigapans/76215/>`_

- `The MassiveBlack II Simulation <http://mbii.phys.cmu.edu/>`_

- `The BlueTides Simulation <http://bluetides-project.org/>`_
