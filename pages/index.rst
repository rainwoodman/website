        Probably need to put a `suited-up` picture here.


I am an associate project scientist at `Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics <http://bccp.berkeley.edu>`_.
I develop and maintain the software stack that supports the research at BCCP, including my own research.

I develop a lot of software packages, and contributes to many more.  Most of these can be found at
`my github page <http://www.github.com/rainwoodman>`_.
In earlier days I was involved with GNOME2 with a side-line project
`gnome-globalmenu <https://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu>`_; I do not think many people still use it;
as the features have been partially included in GNOME3 and Ubuntu Unity.

My professional work spans three fields: 

- cosmology,

- massively parallel super-computing applications, and

- methods and software tools for data analysis;

Please refer to my `CV <https://www.overleaf.com/read/bwbpchbcwcfq>`_; or
`a list of publications <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?library&libname=Papers&libid=5516e5bffc>`_.

Here is a list of research topics and projects that I have contributed to:

- Cosmology

  - Large Scale Structure (LSS) and perturbation theory; [#lya]_ [#eulerrecon]_ [#fastpm]_ [#wiggleornot]_

  - Formation of galaxies, galaxy clusters, star-formation models 
    and super-massive blackholes. [#coldflow]_ [#mbzoom]_ [#mb2]_ [#bluetides]_

  - Weak lensing and intrinsic alignments. [#alignment]_

  - Reduction of imaging data from imaging surveys. [#desi]_

- Super-computing Applications

  - Solver for cosmological hydrodynamics; [#MP-Gadget]_

  - Parallel Fast Fourier Transformation; [#pfft-python]_

  - Massively parallel sorting; [#mpsort]_

  - Efficient launching of Python applications on super-computers; [#python-mpi-bcast]_

- Software and methods for data analysis

  - Automated differentiation [#vmad]_

  - Optimization beyond first order [#abopt]_

  - Parallel data analysis of N-body simulations [#nbodykit]_

  - In-node Map-Reduce via Multi-processing [#sharedmem]_

  - Hierarchical Data Format for large data sets [#bigfile]_

  - KD-tree, pair-wise counting and Friends-of-Friends [#kdcount]_ [#cKDTree]_

  - Visualization of smoothed particle field [#gaepsi]_

I was part of several largest cosmological simulations. 
These simulations required some of the largest super-computers today(or then), running at their full capability 
for days; that's hundreds of millions of CPU-hours.
We do make important predictions about blackholes and galaxies with these simulations.
