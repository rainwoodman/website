C, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and software design
---------------------------------------------------------

`GObject <https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/>`_ enables easier Object oriented Programming in C. 

`GLib <https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable>`_ provides a core functionality library that the 
C programming language, with its long line of heritage, were unable to include into the standard library.

The Python Object system somewhat reassembles a crippled version of GObject system.

OOP is more of a way of thinking than a specific computing language or tool. 
Most of the time it is only a matter where to put the object pointer before or after the function name. 
In the end the computer does no more than following the compiled instructions, accessing the memory 
and/or modifying the registers. 

Some of the knowledgable discussions on `Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc <http://c2.com>`_ are very entertaining, 
though I do not practice extreme programming nor explicitly use patterns in my research projects.
